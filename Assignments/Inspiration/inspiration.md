	Plantery - Hydroponic Care App

[https://www.behance.net/gallery/98450079/Plantery-Hydroponic-Care-App?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Cportfolio](https://www.behance.net/gallery/98450079/Plantery-Hydroponic-Care-App?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Cportfolio)

The message is clearly conveyed because the designer nicely layout the app design.

The target market could be someone who loves plants and would like to take care of the plants. This app helps the audience do what they want to do when interacting with this application.

Yes, I think this app really attracts me. The illustrations are the same style, and the design process is extraordinarily detail-oriented. The designer has great artistic sensibility and precision.

I really love the cover of this portfolio because there is one phone that stands out from everything that really catches people’s eyes.

	Portafolio.

[https://www.behance.net/gallery/105944073/Portafolio?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Cportfolio](https://www.behance.net/gallery/105944073/Portafolio?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Cportfolio)

The message is not very clearly conveyed. This portfolio is simple and clean, but it is more like a way to show all the designs. There is no design process or case study there.

The target market could be people who would like to know the designer in a few seconds. The designer lacks a good understanding of the fundamentals and experience applying its technical aspects to be a good portfolio.

I think the designer could add some case studies to the project, especially the introduction or overview of each project. Then, the audience could better understand what does each project does and make for.

I love the way the designer displays things. I could create covers for each project to make the audience know the project at first glance.

	Portfolio 2020

[https://www.behance.net/gallery/109659831/Portfolio-2020?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Cportfolio](https://www.behance.net/gallery/109659831/Portfolio-2020?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Cportfolio)

The message is almost clearly conveyed. This portfolio is also straightforward. Compared to the previous one, this one contains more details.

The target market could be anyone. I think this one might be good for jobs because it does not need too much time to read.

The audience may seek more diversified projects. The styles of the projects look very similar.

I think I should avoid making every project look the same. My projects should be in different styles to show my creativity.

	Folio 2021 — 02

This is an interactive portfolio. The message is clearly conveyed because the name of the designer and the time are clearly shown on the page. Everything is clearly shown through the timeline.

The target audience could be anyone. The designer conducted work in a professional manner.

The audience may seek more details of each project. Also, the designer may add a title to each project when people are scrolling them.

I think the interaction looks really great, and the scroll effect is also excellent.

	Industrial design Portfolio 2019

[https://www.behance.net/gallery/93030215/Industrial-design-Portfolio-2019?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Cportfolio](https://www.behance.net/gallery/93030215/Industrial-design-Portfolio-2019?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Cportfolio)

The message is not clearly conveyed. This portfolio is not very creative.

The target market could be anyone seeking daily life goods.

The first project HomeWalker is grate because the designer understands what the audiences with disabilities want and how they view the world.

The text is too long and too small to read. The content is not very creative, and they look like an improvement of some existed products.

	CV 2020 - Francesca

[https://www.behance.net/gallery/98624487/CV-2020-Francesca?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Cportfolio](https://www.behance.net/gallery/98624487/CV-2020-Francesca?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Cportfolio)

This CV is really creative, and the message is clearly conveyed. I love the way the designer makes CV as a graphic design.

The target audience could be people who would like to know the basic and necessary information of the designer. The bright purple color is used to generate emotions, create visual interests, and unify personal branding for this design.

If this is used for internships or jobs, employers may seek a more formal and detailed CV.

I could also create a nice designed CV on the website.

	Experience Design Portfolio-2021

[https://www.behance.net/gallery/113773159/Experience-Design-Portfolio-2021?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Cbrainstorming](https://www.behance.net/gallery/113773159/Experience-Design-Portfolio-2021?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Cbrainstorming)

I love this design process. The layout and the color are great. The designer chose yellow to highlight the important ideas. The cut shapes create a visually pleasing design and eye-catching design.

The target audience could be anyone. Even people who are not in this field can quickly get to know the projects.

I think people may seek a brighter color choice because some of the text is handwritten in grey that is very hard to recognize and read.

The designer prefer using pictures and illustrations to express the ideas. I think I may need to add more photos to my case study and final outcome parts.

	Media Economy Report Vol. 14

[https://dribbble.com/shots/13875524-Media-Economy-Report-Vol-14](https://dribbble.com/shots/13875524-Media-Economy-Report-Vol-14)

The message is not clearly conveyed. There are only three incomplete pages for the magazine spread.

I am not sure who the target audience is because it is said to be an economic report, but there is not much useful information that can show the financials.

People may seek more infographics and detailed descriptions in an economic report. Also, people may want to see at least two full pages of the magazine.

I also need to do some magazine mock-ups. I think I should make the pages clearly shown in front of my audience.

	How food came home from

[https://www.coroflot.com/derekbacon_illustration/How-food-came-home](https://www.coroflot.com/derekbacon_illustration/How-food-came-home)

I really love this graphic design. The message is clearly conveyed.

The designer makes common food-related products to build a house, such as cereals, coffee, and wipes. People can easily read those familiar products. The designer created this appealing design using assets such as images and illustrations.

I have a home decoration app project, and I think I can get some inspiration to composite such a virtual house with some building materials and furniture if possible.

	My 2020 Portfolio

[https://www.behance.net/gallery/106038185/My-2020-Portfolio?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Cportfolio](https://www.behance.net/gallery/106038185/My-2020-Portfolio?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Cportfolio)

This portfolio is very creative, particularly the thirteenth page, which is about Sneak Peak Ads. I love the composition of the food.

The designer created a chocolate hand that is unreal but easy to understand.

This ad's target audience would be everyone, like people who are watching television or shopping at a grocery store.

I think I could also make some composite pictures to make my audience better understand the details of the thing.
