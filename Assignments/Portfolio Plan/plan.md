CIM 511
Portfolio Plan

Overview
I would like to show my projects during my college life to represent myself as a designer. My portfolio would be able to show companies in different types, so I would not narrow the portfolio to a single aspects. I intend to pursue my career as a UX/UI Designer, an Interaction Designer, and a Product Designer.
I will use SquareSpace or Webflow to create my personal portfolio website to show my design process and projects.
I have some completed projects during classes, but some of them did not have a documented full design process. I would rethink and develop the design process, and redesign the project if needed.
