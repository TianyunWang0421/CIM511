Reflection:

Seen examples from all my classmates, I think I should generate my own style and represent it more obvious in my identity package.

Updates:

Identity Package:

 - Finished resume editing
 - Printed out a business card, and the color is too grey and dark
 - Need some changes and better color choices


PROJECT Dwarfism Day:

 - Need more time for the VR scene because of my limited skills for Rhino and KeyShot
 - Trying to find and combine a real-life installation
