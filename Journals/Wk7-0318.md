Reflection:

The most challenging part of making the project Dwarfism Day is to make it unique. I do not want it to look like a counseling center or an art installation, but it should have a deeper meaning to inspire people.

I got inspiration from Isabelle's resume. I also want to create two columns for my resume.

Updates:

PROJECT Dwarfism Day:

 - Need to unify the style because sketches look like two styles
