Reflection:

Lauren is a very positive woman with a strong mindset. She knows exactly what she is going to be. She tried to work in lots of types of companies, but her goal is very clean. Her projects are very nice and clean.

I decided not to stick with my Dwarfism Day project this week. One reason is that I feel like I lack some skills. It is hard to learn 3D modeling from the very beginning. So, I want to use more time to learn Unity, Rhino, and KeyShot. Also, I think I need more inspiration now.
