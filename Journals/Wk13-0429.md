Reflection:

Still working on my website.

I am worried about too many animations. Animations may make the users not focus on the content, or they may not be able to know it is an animation.

I tried to make a scrolling effect but not able to make it work. I found a template also from WiX, but it would be very hard to combine it with my website. So, I am watching a lesson to make the scrolling effect myself.

Updates (May 4):

Talked with Dr. Seelig and got lots of useful feedback. I still need to fix the spacing.

  - spacing
  - home page
	  - no "contact me"
  - project 1
	  - boxes background: white
	  - design process: smaller boxes, anchor link
  - project 2
	  - boxes background: same color
	  - final outcome: more obvious arrows? or just put the pictures?
  - project 3
	  - house "restriction" out of page?
  - project 4
	  - topic: proof of content? prototype?
	  - service blueprint + outcome: text color, brighter text
  - profile
	  - resume download button
	  - smaller photo
	  - my experience: add details
	  - my experience: spacing between company name and job title
	  - whole page spacing
  - contact
	  - maybe one page without scrolling
