Reflection:

Foodie is not a very hard project compared to my other projects. This is mainly because I have built apps several times, and I am familiar with the software and skills. I know that how fast it will be when you are really familiar with your tools and you know what you are going to do.

	 - name size smaller
 - business card

 - guraduate schools

 - future career
	 - look for job description instead of job titles
