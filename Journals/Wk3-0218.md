Reflection:

Seen lots of inspiration from classmates in class, I need to focus more on what I do not like.

Also, for the resume part, I should create one that matches my website style.

Updates:

side PROJECT HappyGround:
 - This now only works on my own computer, and it needs to be interactive for others

side PROJECT Timing:
 - Timing should have more functions, maybe relates to another project?
