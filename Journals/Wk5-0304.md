Reflection:

This product design is very difficult for me. One reason is that I forgot some of the Arduino coding skills learned last year. Also, it is hard to get materials when I am at home.

I tried to search through the Internet, but I did not get many inspirations or examples. I will try to finalize and make this project look nice next week.
